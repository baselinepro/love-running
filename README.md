# love-running
a website for a dublin based running community 
Love Running project

The love Running project is a website specifically designed for those individuals who are passionate about running that are based in the Dublin area specifically the Docklands Phoenix Park.

The website caters to running events 5 days a week whereby anyone can participate as long as you are willing to commute, drive or walk depending on whether you are nearby to the Docklands Phoenix Park in Dublin.

The runs will be held 4 days a week with the fifth day being a meetup at the marker hotel for a nice coffee as well as a social gathering. The types of grounds embarked upon will be in the great outdoors with grounds such as trail whereby you are in wooded or forest type areas, as well as urban where you get to experience the scenery and city life of Dublin.

The Love Running website offers a gallery with individuals who have run marathons and participated in mud runs, paint festivals and championship runs to show the fun side of running and how enjoyable it can be for people.

the second is a signup form where individuals are required to sign up so they can get regular updates and emails on anything new as well as participate or join in on events or activities scheduled.

Love Running is more than just a website it is a community for those who wish to better their lives through running and provides informative information on the homepage regarding the benefits of running in all aspects including physical and mental well being.

the following image shows an issue whereby i created two style.css files and was not sure why my code was not being displayed correctly so through help from  slack community memnber i managed to fix the issue by using ctrl a and then pasting the text in the style.css folder located underneath assets then images which then copied and replaced my source code thereby fixing the issue.
